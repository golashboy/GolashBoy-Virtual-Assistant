It is my python based private desktop assistant project named- “MALGO” which helps me to send Email, Play Music, Open Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, GitHub, Tell me about current time etc. It can search anything from Wikipedia through voice commands. It can greet me according to time if time is in between 12 noon to 6 p.m. then it says Good Afternoon Himanshu Sir Did you Have Your Lunch or not? in Microsoft Agent voice [API used-sapi5]. It can also send WhatsApp messages through voice command to any phone number which you enter in the code. I am also using energy and pause threshold concept for minimize the surrounding noise so that it can easily recognize our voice within that range. Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant? Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command. I can take screenshot of our screen through voice command and save it to our local storage as well.
I can also use as many modules using pip install command in the future to improve it.
Used Libraries: -
pyttsx3, Speech-recognition, DateTime, Wikipedia, smtplib, Pywhatkit (For WhatsApp
Messaging Automation), webbrowser, datetime, etc.

So, it is very much helpful in the tasks which we all are doing or performing on a regular basis.
